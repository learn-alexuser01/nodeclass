## Week 2

The complete code from lessons covered during week 2.

The success of this code should simple launch a configured express server that doesnt actually do anything (yet).

### Setup

Ensure your project structure looks like the following:

```
/(your_project_name)
---/helpers
---/controllers
---/public
------/css
------/img
------/js
------/upload
----------/temp
---/server
---/views
------/layouts
------/partials
```

### To Launch

```
    $ npm install
    $ node server.js
    Server up: http://localhost:3300
```
